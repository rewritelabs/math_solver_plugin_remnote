## FAQ

**What happens when I uninstall the plugin?**

Your math will still be there as it gets stored as LaTeX inside RemNote. However, if you edit the LaTeX directly and then reinstall the plugin, your manual changes will be overwritten when you recalculate.

**Do others need the plugin to see my math?**

No, shared math is visible to everyone as it's stored in RemNote's math blocks. You only need the plugin to edit and calculate new expressions.

**What happens after my free trial ends?**

You will lose the ability to edit or create new math expressions until you purchase the full version. Your existing math notes will remain visible but cannot be modified.

**Can I use this offline?**

Yes, no internet connection is required to use the plugin.
